    "Twinkle, twinkle little stars",
    "When we look at the sky at night from earth, we see some of the stars twinkling like this",
    "Stars that twinkle - varying in brightness are known as Variable stars",
    "However some stars that we see on earth with our naked eyes may not be variable stars. In fact the twinkling may be caused by the earth's turbulent atmosphere interfering with the star light as they travel to the earth's surface",
    "Also some stars that we see at night that do not twinkle are actually variable stars but their twinkling is much too subtle to be seen with our naked eyes",
    "Even earth based telescopes are also prone to this problems, coupled with the fact that we can only study the stars with our eyes or these telescopes at night",
    "So in order to detect and study the variations in brightness of the stars in the universe we have to use more powerful space telescopes deployed 'above' earth's turbulent atmosphere",
    "These space telescopes and satellites collect data about the brightness of stars over a period of time and these brightness are plotted against the time period - forming a 'Light curve'.",
    "These light curves are used to learn more about the star's structure and evolution, other planets in our galaxy or in other galaxies that orbit the stars and much more about our universe in general",
    "Click on the telescope below... Let's travel above the earth's atmosphere and discover the variable stars in our universe",
    "Click on any of the variable stars to discover why they are... variable."
